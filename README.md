 # About the project
 
I've always been fascinated with building or creating things from scatch. I'm also intrigued about the science behind communication applications, as well as server
client communications. It has led me to the creation of Chatter, a communications platform built with a server-side middle-man and MySQL as a storage service. 
 
The web-application uses server-side authentication by providing the user with an access token, provided that credentials match, that is required to finalize the login attemtps. User account are validated by credentials, such as an email address and password. The password is stored using argon2ID encryption and is the main aspect of authentication.
